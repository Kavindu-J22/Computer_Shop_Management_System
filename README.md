# Computer_Shop_Management_System
#### Brief Description of Project ðŸ“š - 

  - SKYLINE Technologies is a computer shop management system that has a good client base. The company 
sells computers, computer accessories, and other technical equipment. Also, as a third party, this company 
buys the items from other sellers. We can introduce Skyline Technologies as a strong and well-reputed 
company in the field of computers and technical equipment. This system enables customers, employees
as well as sellers to get the service they need safely and comfortably. It is a solution for computer shops 
to manage customers, employees and sellers in an easier and more convenient way.
As a result, an automated system is implemented across eight functions in this project. They are Employee 
Management, Customer Management, Stock Management, Seller Management, Exchanges Management, 
Delivery Management, Employee Salary Management and Repair Management. Therefore, this 
computerized system helps to overcome issues in the manual system and bring a significant improvement 
for the computer shop. This approach is good for maintaining everything in a computer-based manner.
For this project, the SKYLINE Technologies computer shop management system, our team members 
chose a set of functionalities after discussing how to create a web-based application in order to overcome 
the challenges faced in the manual system. Our hope is to make all of the client's tasks easier, to prepare 
the system to provide superior service to the customer, to be able to improve and improve the service 
provided, and to provide users of this web application with a very easy, user friendly, and fresh experience. 
We have decided to use the MERN stack as the technology and GitHub for version control.
